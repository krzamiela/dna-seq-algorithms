My solutions to Coursera's Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course, offered through John Hopkins

## Algo_HW1_Naive.ipynb

- Implementation of the naive exact matching algorithm that is strand-aware (will also match if the reverse complement matches)
- Implementation of an approximate matching algorithm that allows up to two mismatches per read
- Implementation of an algorithm to find the sequencing cycle with the most errors (lowest average quality)
